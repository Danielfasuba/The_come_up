## Malware Memory Analysis

### Overview

Obfuscated malware is a persistent threat in the cybersecurity landscape, it is capable of hiding from detection and analysis. This project focuses on obfuscated malware detection through memory analysis. The dataset represents a real-world scenario with prevalent malware types, including Spyware, Ransomware, and Trojan Horses. The goal is to build a robust malware classifier model capable of effectively categorizing memory dumps as benign or malicious.

### Data Wrangling

In the data wrangling phase, I employed Pandas functions and tools to assess the dataset for missing values. Fortunately, there were no missing values across all attributes. However, I identified irrelevant attributes filled with NULL values across all instances. To clean data, I wrote a function to remove these attributes as part of the data preparation pipeline.

### Data Exploration

Data exploration involved the use of histograms and Density-KDE plots to visualize and gain insights into the data. The obscurity of attributes in the obfuscated malware dataset presented challenges in interpreting the data. However, descriptive statistics, together with visualizations, allowed me to detect outliers and uncertainties.
To understand attribute relationships, I computed the correlation matrix, providing insights into feature importance. Using the standard correlation coefficient (Pearsonâ€™s r) between attributes, I assessed the correlation between each attribute and the target attribute "Class." Strong positive correlations, strong negative correlations, or no linear correlations were identified.

### Predictive Analysis

In the predictive analysis phase, I cleaned and prepared the data for modeling. Two classic machine learning algorithms were employed to build baseline models: Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine. Scikit-learn facilitated model training, and model performance was evaluated using various metrics, including Precision, Recall, ROC_AUC score, and model training speed.

### Model Evaluation & Testing

For model evaluation and testing, we selected the ROC_AUC metric, commonly used in binary classification tasks. It measures the area under the ROC curve, plotting True Positive Rate (Recall) against False Positive Rate (FPR). Both Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine algorithms performed exceptionally well in the Malware Memory Analysis task. Ultimately, the Support Vector Machine was chosen as the final model due to its superior performance results and faster training speed.

This project contributes to the field of cybersecurity by providing an effective solution for obfuscated malware detection in memory dumps. The Support Vector Machine model demonstrates its capabilities in tackling this challenging problem, highlighting its potential for real-world cybersecurity applications.
