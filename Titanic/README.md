## Titanic Survival Prediction

### Overview

The Titanic dataset is a well-known and educational machine learning problem, particularly suitable for beginners. It revolves around the passengers aboard the ill-fated Titanic in 1912. The dataset provides various attributes for each passenger, including age, sex, cabin, class, and more. The primary objective of this task is to predict whether a passenger survived the tragic sinking of the Titanic.

### Data Exploration

I embarked on this project by conducting a thorough exploration of the dataset. Key aspects of this exploration included:

- **Descriptive Statistics:** To understand the dataset's essential characteristics and gain insights into passenger demographics.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating histograms and visual representations of the data attributes to comprehend attribute distributions and patterns.

This initial analysis allowed me to grasp the nature of the task at hand, which is a classic binary classification problem.

### Data Preprocessing

Preparing the data for machine learning involved several critical steps:

- **Handling Missing Values:** Given the significant number of missing values in the "Cabin" attribute, I decided to remove it entirely. For other attributes with missing values, I filled them in with median attribute values to maintain data integrity.
- **Feature Scaling:** I utilized Scikit-Learn's StandardScaler for feature scaling to ensure all attributes contributed equally to model training.
- **Encoding Categorical Features:** Employing OneHotEncoder, I transformed categorical features into a suitable format for machine learning.

### Model Training and Evaluation

I opted to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on the preprocessed data. The choice was made due to its capacity for handling both linear and non-linear classification tasks.

- **Performance Metric:** I evaluated the model's performance using accuracy as the primary metric. The objective was to determine how effectively the model predicts passenger survival.

### Model Evaluation

To assess the model's predictive capabilities, I conducted a thorough evaluation process, which included:

- **Cross-Validation:** Employing cross-validation techniques on the training set to ensure robustness and minimize overfitting.
- **Test Set Evaluation:** Evaluating the model on a separate test dataset to validate its performance on unseen data.

The results were highly satisfying, with the Support Vector Classifier achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 98.8 percent. This demonstrated the model's proficiency in distinguishing survivors from non-survivors among Titanic passengers.

### Conclusion

This Titanic Survival Prediction project marked a significant milestone for me as it was my first solo project without the guidance of an online course instructor or book. It showcases the power of machine learning in tackling real-world classification challenges. The high accuracy achieved by the Support Vector Classifier underscores the model's effectiveness in predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. This project serves as an excellent starting point for those new to machine learning.
